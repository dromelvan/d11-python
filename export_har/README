The stuff in this directory is used for fetching HAR files from Fotmob in order to grab a valid authenication token.

Installation:

* Copy export-har.scpt to ~/.scripts
* Copy com.d11.exporthar.plist to ~/Library/LaunchAgents. 
  Change <string>/Users/<user>/.scripts/export-har.scpt</string> to correct username.
  Change <string><url></string> to the URL we want to poll.
* Open Safari manually, open the inspector and select the Network tab. Safari will remember this when the script is run. 
  Also download something to select the directory the script will download to. Safari will remember this too.
* Go to ~/.scripts and test the script by doing:
  osascript export-har.scpt <url>
  The first time it is run we will likely have to click some approvals and add some permissions which means it won't succeed.
  Run it again and check that a .har file for the URL has been created in the selected download directory.
  The x-mas header with authentication token should be present in some request in the .har file.
* Start the schedule by doing:
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.d11.exporthar.plist  
* Stop the schedule by doing:
  launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.d11.exporthar.plist
